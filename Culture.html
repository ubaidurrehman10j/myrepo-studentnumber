      <p>The culture of England and the United Kingdom is vastly diverse. Made up of four countries; England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, each sector of the UK has its own identity and traditions. 

        Our guide on the UK for international students will teach you everything you need to know about living abroad for your studies.

        <h4>How to immerse yourself in UK culture 
        </h4>
        <p>Living in the UK can seem daunting to international students at first. Rather than trying to avoid culture shock, you should try to embrace it. A great way of doing this is to immerse yourself in UK culture and traditions.

          One of the best ways to immerse yourself in the culture of the United Kingdom is to visit museums. A lot of museums around the UK are free to visit and they are an excellent way to learn the history of where you are studying.  </p>
          <h4>UK festivals 
          </h4>
          <p>Festivals are a large part of UK culture with over 800 music festivals alone taking place every year. Although music festivals are one of the main attractions in the UK, other festival types also include wellness, arts and literary and food.

            Food festivals, showcasing national and international cuisines, are becoming increasingly more common around the UK with each city having its own. </p>
